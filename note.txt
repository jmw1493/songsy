x - 1. finish the demo
x - 2. make login
x - 3. design db and s3 structure
  - db entities and relationships
    - user
      - id
      - username
      - email
      - # songs - user can have many songs
    - song
      - id
      - title
      - songUrl - s3 url
      - coverArtUrl - s3 url
      - userId - user who created song (songs can only have one)
    - likes
      - id
      - userId
      - songId
      - # likes belong to one user
      - # user can have many likes
      - # songs can have many likes
x - 4. make upload song (profile page) (only thing on the page right now)
x - 5. make retrieve song and cover art (explore page) (only one song on explore page right now)
x - 6. songs are playable in explore page
x - 7. fill out explore page 
x - 8. audio player to work perfectly on explore page
x - 9. song popup on explore page
x - 10. improve home page to have side nav - upload song, my songs, my likes, explore
x - 11. figure out how to compress images (function?)
x - 12. my songs come in by created date

UI most imp
x - 13. everything (esp explore page) works and looks good on mobile
x - 14. better login screen
x - 15. better submit song UI
16. better loading ui
17. images are compressing and loading properly

UI less imp
18. songmodal positions on top when screen size isn't big enough for song modal to go off to side
  - maybe determine if it's best to put modal left, right, up, and/or down, and how much to that/those directions (maybe for small screen you offset the modal 50% in the x direction)
19. routing

Artist name
20. user can create their artist name
21. author (username) of song appears in songmodal

Song likes
22. can like songs - user creates like, read all liked songs for user, user delete like

Extra
23. explore page - load more when screen size changes
24. explore page - load more when scroll to bottom
25. explore page - songs are in order of most recently created
  - maybe show the songs you've made?


... use functions for something
- compress images
- explore page get random songs
  a. get basic function working
  b. get basic db query in function working
  c. make the pulled songs random and receive specific number of results as input
    * ensure passing in larger number than amount in db won't cause error
