12. figure out how to compress images (function?)

... use functions for something
- compress images
- explore page get random songs
  a. get basic function working
  b. get basic db query in function working
  c. make the pulled songs random and receive specific number of results as input
    * ensure passing in larger number than amount in db won't cause error
